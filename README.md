[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/ "Ansible website") is a `configuration management` tool
that can be used to `automate` the `deployment` of applications and services.
It is `agentless` and `uses SSH` to connect to remote hosts.

Ansible is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and is open source.
It is a very popular tool for [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops)
and is used by many companies.

This repository contains tasks and exercises to practise
CI/CD on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using Ansible, as per
[Udacity's DevOps Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-dev-ops-nanodegree--nd9991).

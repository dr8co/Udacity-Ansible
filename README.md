Ansible is a `configuration management` tool that can be used to
automate the deployment of applications and services.
It is `agentless` and `uses SSH` to connect to remote hosts.
Ansible is written in Python and is open source.
It is a very popular tool for DevOps and is used by many companies.

This repository contains tasks and exercises to practise
CI/CD on AWS using Ansible, as per UdaCity's DevOps Nanodegree.
